# Tennis Kata

A Zoom coding TDD coding exercise based on the [Tennis Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Tennis/).
I will be using a Git commit style of:
* RED after adding tests for new function
* GREEN after changing code to pass those (and all previous) tests
* BLUE if successfully refactor the GREEN code without breaking the tests.
  * I mark it as BLUE rather than REFACTOR as 
    * there is limited space for commit titles
    * the three stage process used a blue color for the refactor stage

To see the wood for the trees:
* [The Brief](#the-brief)
* [The Plan](#the-plan)
* [The Result](#the-result)

## The Brief
This will go here from the kata link above

## The Plan
Before I start I only know that it is called Tennis,
so I will rename the Main class as Tennis
and create a simple failing and then fixed test
to seed the TDD process and check all is working with Git, etc.

## The Result
